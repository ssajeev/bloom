Bloom is a 3D simulation for plant growth. It gives the user the
option to change environmental factors such water, UV levels, and
temperature and see the resulting changes in both a 3D plant
representation and a 2D cell representation.
Implementation: This project was implemented in Python 3 and pygame.
OpenGL was used for the 3D graphics. All the graphics in this
application were developed by the owner in Maya and Photoshop. In
addition the sklearn machine learning library was used to predict how
the plant will react to different environmental conditions. The Random
Forest Regressor Algorithm was used for this purpose as there were
different attributes given that lead to one result. Scipy and numpy
were used to implement the reaction diffusion reaction of cell growth.
